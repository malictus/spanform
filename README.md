Spanform - Spectral Analysis for Musicians
==========================================

Spanform performs FFT analysis of WAV files and saves the output in a separate analysis file. This file can be viewed visually on the screen or printed, and modified in a number of ways. Audio features allow the sound file to be played while viewing the
analysis file, and playback can be monitored via a scrolling cursor.

This program is Windows only, and was written back in 2000 using Visual C++ 6, and transferred to GitHub without modification for safe-keeping. The spanform.zip file contains everything you need to run the program, including some tutorial files that explain how to use it.

This program was written in its entirety by James Halliday, with the exception of the FFT algorithm, which was adapted from code 
written by Don Cross, used by permission.
